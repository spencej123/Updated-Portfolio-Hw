                        <p>In this particular picture (above), I had just graduated from the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. I was excited, but also thinking about what I wanted to do moving forward. Why? Because I, a music lover and language learner, had recently been introduced to the wonders of web development. Let me explain, while I was in college getting my Chinese language and literature degree, I made a few friends who just so happened to be computer science majors. I don't know how it happened, I loved to sing, write songs, and learn languages. They, on the other hand, loved... math. Sometimes the most impactful friendships just happen, and you don't ask why, you just be thankful that they did. They showed me different websites they were building for fun, and even some projects they were working on in school as well as projects they'll be doing after graduation. I began to be intruiged by the idea of learning web development. I'm still intruiged to this day. I want to learn to make my own websites, and join others in working on bigger projects. In the picture above, I was still mulling it over. Back then, I wondered if I could do it. It's been 3 years since that picture was taken, and my interest has only grown. Now I know with hard work, I can do it. So now I'm here, learning more about web development each day. Think of this portfolio as snap shots of my journey as I imporve. However, by the time I'd be seriously showing this to anyone, I'd hope to only have my best posted on here. I only aim to put my best foot forward. For now, this is my best foot...for now.
